# Weatherman-Portfolio

## Overview
Greetings and welcome to the start of 2022. I hope everyone had a wonderful holiday season. For this project, we will be creating a protfolio website using a combination of html and advanced CSS code. This can be a bit of a challenge, but do not panic. This REAME will discuss the purpose of having a professional portfolio and the creative process for the coding necessary for developing your own portfolio website.

## Why have a portfolio?
In the corporate world, it is important to have all the necessary tools to proceed into the employment process for your next dream job. This includes polishing your resume, showcasing samples of previous projects/work experience, and crafting cover letters about why you would be the perfect fit for the job. This is where a portfolio comes in handy. A porftfolio is a collection of the canidate's best work to showcase their capabilities to prospective employers. Exmaples of this include web designers showcasing their web applications to writers displaying their best articles. Professional portfolios include work samples AND the thought process behind them. This leads us into our user story.

## User Story
Our user story is thus:

As an employer, I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples SO THAT I can review samples of their work and asses whether they are a good canidate for an open position.

The jest is simple enough. We need to create a portfolio (using html and CSS) and we need to deploy it so that it is online for others to view our work samples. Now....we get into the acceptance criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria
So here is our checklist that we need to deploy our portfolio to satisfy a typical hiring manager's needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click on one of these links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's iamage should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

If you do not have any applications delpoyed yet, then you can suppliment this by having placeholder images and names.

## Description of Code

So for this portfolio, we have three pieces:
> 1. portfolio.html [portfolio.html] (This is our sematic html file with the backbone information for our portfolio)

> 2. reset-style.css [reset-style.css] (This is the css file that allows the developer to reset the styling of our HTML file(s) to a consistent baseline. This lets us design our html file from scrtach)

> 3. portfolio-style.css [portfolio-style.css] (This is the css file that contains all of the styling and formating for our HTML file)
